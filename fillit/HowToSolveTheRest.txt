Solver function:

1. Create new box 
2. Backtracker
	y then x in double loop;
	if it's possible to place the tet, then start at 0, 0;
	if not, keep iterating (x + 1?);
	temp = recursive backtrack;
	clean just the last tet if you can't find anything;

	If the whole thing is false, increase box size by 1. 

	When you place the tet, assign the letter then.
